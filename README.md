##Snap Jam##

Snap jam is our final group project for Dev Academy.

The idea was to create an app that allows you to upload and play and share compositions with multiple people.

One of the main technical hurdles was playing multiple audiofiles together without any delay. 

I was part of the team creating the actual audio player, and generally helping with styling and brainstorming various components etc.

The main inputs for the audioplayer were intially Isaac,then Tasman and I did a lot of work before finally having Gerard ( one of our facilitators) help us significantly ( see the code).

It was a great project to be apart of, and hopefully it's something we will continue on in future!
